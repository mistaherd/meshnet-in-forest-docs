Mesh network in Forest - Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for the Mesh network in Forest project. This repository provides comprehensive guides, tutorials, and resources for building, deploying, and maintaining a resilient, off-grid mesh network in challenging forested environments.

ðŸŒ³ About The Project


Forested areas present unique challenges for communication due to signal attenuation from foliage, varied terrain, and lack of power infrastructure. This project aims to provide a practical, open-source solution for creating reliable communication networks for various applications, such as:

- Environmental Monitoring: Collecting data from sensors (temperature, humidity, soil moisture).

- Wildlife Tracking: Relaying location data from animal collars.

- Wildfire Detection: Early warning systems based on sensor data.

- Remote Communication: Providing a text-based communication link for researchers, hikers, or park rangers in areas without cell service.

This documentation covers everything from selecting the right hardware and configuring the software to deployment strategies and long-term maintenance.
