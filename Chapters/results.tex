In thes section i will  be showing results for  different aspects of this project this  will  include the following:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Recorded data from sensors
    \item Recorded data from transciver
    \item Recorded data from  testing the mesh network
\end{enumerate}
\section{Recorded data from sensor}
in this section  will have  tables from the following componets:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item DHT22 \textbf{heat and temp}
    \item AS312 \textbf{Motion }
    \item DFR0026 \textbf{Light}
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{DHT22}
\begin{table}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
        \hline
        date/time of record & Tempeature &Humidity 
        \hline\hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Recorded data from  DHT22 on the \today}
    \label*{Recorded data from  DHT22 on the \today}
\end{table}
\subsection*{AS312}
\begin{table}
    \begin{tabular*}{|c|c|}
        date/time of record & motion detected(yes/no)
    \end{tabular*}
    \caption*{Recorded data from  AS312 on the \today}
