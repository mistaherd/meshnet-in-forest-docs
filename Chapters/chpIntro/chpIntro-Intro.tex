This project discusses the process of developing a mesh network from the sensor to serial level Communication, Communication is a key infrastructure in electronics and technology, as this can depict data between different devices, The nature of this is not a simple one due to several factors such as when an object obstructs the path of the signal, other signals interfering with the information that is being sent across the communication channel, There are multiple ways of avoiding this interaction one way on a high level is to use a mesh network like Lora, a mesh network is a type of network where no node in the network acts as a master meaning no device controls the each other. Imagine a group of friends playing a game of telephone. In a regular game, the message goes from one person to the next in a line. But what if, instead of a line, the friends formed a circle, and everyone could whisper the message to the person next to them? That's kind of how a mesh network works. this is possible thanks to the routing of each device. these will select what device talks to each other  this project will look at the nature of  this  interaction
