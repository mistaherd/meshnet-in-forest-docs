\section{Introduction}
In this  Section the  proposed  methodology of this  project will be discussed this will cover the  following:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The Procedure of the project
    \item The Additional research
    \item The setup of the Raspberry Pi
    \item The Software Model Development
    \item The Data Analysis Methods
    \item The validity and reliability 
    \item The Limitations and Delimitation
    \item The timeline
\end{enumerate} 
\section{Procedure}
The following are the steps of this project:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Consider the environment in which we commutate across
    \item Determine the desired range for the sensor to operate in.
    \item Find the wide range of components available
    \item Limit the base hardware based on the constraints of the project
    \item Select hardware based on these constraints
    \item State the software needed for the project
    \item State how to setup the software
    \item State the software needed to drive this sensor
    \item Write unit test to develop the software
    \item Discuss how to track the sensor data
    \item Discuss the timeline of the project
    \item Discuss the limitations 
  
\end{enumerate}
\section{Setup of raspberry pi}
Firstly once you have  your pi  heres  a  quick  guide to setup the pi are  the following:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Unpack the  pi be sure  to  connect keyboard mouse  and hdmi cable
    \item Download the  raspberry pi imager and  select the  32 bit  recommend os 
    \item Put the  micro\_SD card  into  the pi once the  pi is  setup you can make sub directories for this project type the  following:
    \begin{verbatim}
        git clone https://github.com/mistaherd/meshnetwork_in_forest.git
    \end{verbatim}
    This  will download the  essentially  environment for  setting up the  Pi  initial this will have to built out  through the  process of  the   project look at the timeline Section
    \item Next configure the legacy camera  options
    \begin{verbatim}
        sudo raspi-config
    \end{verbatim}
    \item Download the following tools from linux
    \begin{verbatim}
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install raspistill
        sudo apt install tmux
    \end{verbatim}
    \item set working directory and activate  virtual environment
    \begin{verbatim}
        cd <path/to/of/your/own>/meshnetwork_in_forest
        source env/bin/activate
    \end{verbatim}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Data Analysis Methods}
In this section we will Discuss the tool we use to analyze the sensor data the following will be discussed:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Met Eireann weather forecast API
    \item Matplotlib
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Met Eireann weather forecast API}
we can compare our humidity and temperature and compare this will the output of this  API
\subsection{Matplotlib}
we can use this libraries to plot our changes in the data.


\section{Timeline}
The research  phase will be  conducted from 20/09/2023 to \today.The prosed impanation phase is from january till \today
The project file timeline can be visualized as  the following:
