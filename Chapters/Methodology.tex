\section{Introduction}
In this  Section  i will discuss the  proposed  methodology of this  project this will cover the  following:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The setup of the raspberry pi
    \item The Data Collection Methods
    \item The Model Development
    \item The Data Analysis Methods
    \item The Ethical Considerations
    \item The validity and reliability 
    \item The Limitations and Delimitation
    \item The timeline
\end{enumerate} 
\section{Setup of raspberry pi}
Firstly once you have  your pi  heres  a  quick  guide to setup the pi are  the following:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item once you unpack the  pi be sure  to  connect keyboard mouse  and hdmi cable
    \item next on a computer you must download the  raspberry pi imager and  selet the  64 bit  recommned os 
    \item once u have os set simpley put the  mircosd card  into  the pi once the  pi is  setup you can make sub dirrys for this project type the  following:
    \begin{verbatim}
        git clone https://github.com/mistaherd/meshnetwork_in_forest.git
    \end{verbatim}
    this  will downlaod the  nessary  eniroment for  setinng up the  pi  intiall this will have to built out  through the  process of  the   project look at the timeline Section
    \item next simply follow the ReadME.md file  to  understand  how  to setup the py
\end{enumerate}
\section{Data Collection Methods}
In this section  i dicuss the  following:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item the  intall  unit test this is for  what we  expect  our  sensor  to  output this  will  be  updated
    \item How  the data  from sensor will be stored 
    \item the code  assoicated   with the above points 
\end{enumerate}


\section{Software Module Development}
this section is here to dicuss the method we took  for  developing software  for the  following:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Sensors 
    \item ADC
    \item Camera
    \item Radio module
    \item Memory mangemnet
    \item  TDD
\end{enumerate}

\section{Data Analysis Methods}

Statistical and machine learning techniques are employed to analyze the data collected from both computational models and real-world sources. These techniques are used to identify patterns, trends, and relationships within the data.

\section{Ethical Considerations}

The use of computational methods raises ethical concerns regarding data privacy and security. To address these concerns, data anonymization and encryption techniques are employed to protect sensitive information. Additionally, informed consent is obtained from participants when applicable.

\section{Validity and Reliability}

Validation of computational models is achieved through rigorous testing and evaluation. This involves comparing model predictions with real-world data and examining the sensitivity of the models to different parameters. Reliability is ensured through the use of standardized methods and procedures for data collection, analysis, and interpretation.

\section{Limitations and Delimitations}

The computational nature of the research introduces limitations due to the complexity of the systems being modeled and the potential for errors in modeling and data analysis. Moreover, the generalizability of the findings may be limited to the specific contexts and conditions considered in the research.

\section{Timeline}

The model development phase of the research is scheduled to take place from [start date] to [end date]. The data collection and analysis phases are scheduled to take place from [start date] to [end date]. The final write-up of the research is scheduled to be completed by [deadline date].
