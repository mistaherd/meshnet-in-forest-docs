In this section we will discuss the following:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Results of the sensor data
    \item Results of the camera
    \item Results of the lora module
\end{enumerate}
\section{Discussion of results of Sensor data}
in this section the data gather from sensor will be discussed Note:(\textbf{all test here where conducted indoors}):
\begin{enumerate}
    \item DHT22 (Temperature \& Humidity)

    On page \pageref{Recorded data from  DHT22 on the 5th of march} compared to the average room temperature which is  20$^o$c ,The range of humidity in a room is from 30\% to 60\% in the plot on page \pageref{Temperature and Humidity plotted overtime} note in the file sensor_data.csv there entries  that are 0 , this is due to  testing different components and make these values as  0.during the devlopment stage of this proejct we ran unit tests  this module as seen on page \pageref{unit test message for DHT22 module}
    \item AS312 (Motion )
    As seen on page \pageref{}
    \item DFR0026 (Lux )
\end{enumerate}
