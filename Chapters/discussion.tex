In this section we will discuss the following:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Results of the sensor data
    \item Results of the camera
    \item Results of the lora module
\end{enumerate}
\section{Discussion of results of Sensor data}
in this section the data gather from sensor will be discussed Note:(\textbf{all test here where conducted indoors}):
\begin{enumerate}
    \item DHT22 (Temperature \& Humidity):

    On page \pageref{Recorded data from  DHT22 on the 5th of march} compared to the average room temperature which is  20$^o$c ,The range of humidity in a room is from 30\% to 60\% in the plot on page \pageref{Temperature and Humidity plotted overtime} note in the file sensor\_data.csv there entries  that are 0 , this is due to  testing different components and make these values as  0.during the development stage of this project we ran unit tests  this module as seen on page \pageref{unit test message for DHT22 module}.
    \item AS312 (Motion ):

    As seen on page \pageref{Recorded data from AS312 on the \today} this will output table that is True when an object is detected and  false when no object is  detected

    \item DFR0026 (Lux ):
    As seen on page \pageref{Recorded data from DFR0026 on the 25th of march 2024} is a table full of  lux values according to  this \href{https://www.thoughtco.com/lighting-levels-by-room-1206643}{link} we ideally want a lux value  of  800 to 1700 lux which satisfies these conditions.
\end{enumerate}
\section{Discussion of Results of camera data}
As seen on page \pageref{A photo from 25th of march 2024} which shows  an image that was taken by the camera  attached to  the pi
\section{Discussion of Lora module}
\label{Discussion of Lora module}
While updating repository for this section the Pi's sd cards where corrupted due to  a fault binary file which was  later fixed  but  this error lead to the following error message:
