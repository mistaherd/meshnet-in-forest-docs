For this section, we have to consider the following:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item How are we setting up the network
		\item What framework are we using to set this Up
		\item What are the advantages/disadvantages
	\end{enumerate}
	In my research I found two main frameworks that this project could use to achieve the mesh network these are the following:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item LORA
		\item Zigbee
	\end{enumerate}
	According to Chen (2023)\cite{chen} "LoRa, as one of Low Power Wide Area Networks (LP-WANs) technologies, aims to enable IoT devices to perform long-range communications with lower power consumption [18]. LoRa makes use of the chirp spread spectrum (CSS) modulation to improve the transmission distance up to kilometres and also be resistant to multi-path effects."
	\par
	According to Vlad\cite{Gavra_Pop_Dobra_2023}, "ZigBee is an LP-WPAN (Low-Power-Wireless Personal Area Network) with short range and low power consumption, as mentioned before. The range for ZigBee devices is up to fifty meters and it is characterized by a low data rate, having a maximum value of 250 kbps. The protocol is suitable for sensors and IoT applications because of the low data rate and low power consumption"
	\par
	the following are the  differences between the two:
	\begin{table}[h]

		\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
		\hline
		\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{LoRa} & \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{ZigBee} \\
		\hline
		Advantages & Disadvantages & Advantages & Disadvantages \\
		\hline
		Long transmission distance & Low transmission rate & Low power consumption & Low data rate \\
		Low power consumption & Slow data transfer rate & Long range & Limited range \\
		Multi-channel information procession & Small payload & Scalability & Signal interference \\
		Strong anti-interface ability & Low bandwidth & $-$ & High-sensitivity levels \\
		High-sensitivity levels & Spectrum interference \\
		\hline
		\end{tabular}
		\caption{Advantages and Disadvantages of LoRa and ZigBee}

		\end{table}
		from research, these are very  similar  but it seems if I plan on adding lots of Zigbee is the best for this challenge
