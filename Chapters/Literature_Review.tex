\section{Review  key of research Papers}
The following are the research papers I used
\begin{enumerate}
	
	\item zhao
	
		In my research, I found  multiple projects that are similar to mine 
		In Zhao(2023)\cite[zhao]{zhao}  
		used  LORA to  track  light sensitivity, air pressure
		one of the challenges Zhao came across was Attenuation as stated above and also the author came across the problem of not having sufficient solar panels 
	\item Daniel
	
		Another paper I found in my research is by Daniel \cite{Daniel}
		In this, Daniel discusses modeling radio wave propagation in a forest environment which isn't in the scope of the project
		Daniel's work shows that a better approximation  for transmission loss was a key read to  under what happens on a more in-depth scale in my project
	
	\item Anna
	
		\cite{Anna} in Anna's paper  she  mainly used LORA where she compared line of sight and  the  non-line  line of sight environments in  urban and  forested areas
		this paper aims to study the effects of signal propagation in different environments.
	

	\item ITU
	
		\cite{ITU} in ITU in most research papers I found  it  referred back to this  document this document was  very helpful in terms  of  understanding Attenuation  and challenges that face

\end{enumerate}


\section{Summary}
This report  highlights the  challenges at come from  transmitting data in a  wooded area these challenges are  the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Attenuation 
\item Absorption
\end{enumerate}
In a wooded area, we established that  Attenuation occurs due to the reflection, and penetration of radio through any type of medium.
We established that our antenna will have to  be in the  Mhz range   but will still have signal loss /errors due to Absorption of  the  signal  received due  to rain or water being in the signal path
we have yet to consider the non-line of sight environment but this  is  to be  discussed when prototyping, this report mainly focuses on the hardware where the  focus is on  sensors such as:
\begin{itemize}
\item Temperature
\item Light
\item Motion
\item Humidity
\end{itemize} 
The report focuses on how to read this data from a  Software perspective the code will be an object-oriented program
where the code will be separated into different blocks of code so the file size is minimized and leads to a faster compile time.
