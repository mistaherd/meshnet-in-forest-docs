\section{Conclusion}
\label{ch:conclusion} % For easy referencing

In this final year project, we have explored the implementation and development of mesh networks within the challenging environment of a forest. Through [briefly summarize your methods], we have successfully demonstrated the [key results or achievements]. Our findings underscore the potential for mesh networks to revolutionize [specific areas or applications within forest environments].

\subsection{Key Contributions}

This project has contributed significantly to the understanding of mesh networks in forest settings by:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Developinga Model:} In this we used serial communication to test the nature of  which the network will send/ receive data from the network 
    \item \textbf{Addressing Challenges:} in a line of sight environment the sending and receiving of image is a hard task due to  how large the file is byte by byte
    \item \textbf{Performance Evaluation:} every method eventually worked via serial but image files had the  most problems
    \item \textbf{Practical Implications:} this we can schedule the sending  and  receiveing  of data we can use this to extract the sensor data
\end{itemize}

\section{Future Work}

While this project hasn't achieved its core objectives, several avenues for future research and development remain open:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Sockets:} The project could of ventrured into socket programming ,A socket is an endpoint of a two-way communication link between two programs running on the network.we picked serial communication for testing  but this is where the main server and client can defined.
    \item \textbf{Helpful Tools:}  Linux has a wide range of networking tools such as:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item\textbf{Nmap} is a network scanner designed to discover hosts and services on a computer network. It sends packets and analyzes the responses to gather information 
        \item \textbf{ifconfig} Which provides extensive control over interfaces, addresses and routes
        \item \textbf{traceroute} Traces the route packets take to reach a destination
        \item \textbf{route} Displays or manipulates the kernel's IP routing table
        \item \textbf{arp} Displays and manages the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) cache, which maps IP addresses to MAC addresses
        \item \textbf{tcpdump} Captures and analyzes network traffic, useful for diagnosing network issues.
        \item \textbf{iftop} Displays a real-time bandwidth monitor for network interfaces.
    \end{itemize} 
    \item \textbf{Energy Efficiency:} Investigate further what can be done to make  our system more energy effective i.e piplineing the sensor data
    \item \textbf{Security:} Investigate how to make our data secure via rsa and different protocols
    \item \textbf{PCB board :} After testing the board one problem was wiring up the sensor a potential for making a custom  Pi hat that will provide an easy was of connecting  our sensor 
 
   
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Final Remarks}
The deployment of mesh networks in forest environments holds immense promise. The work presented here serves as a solid foundation for future endeavors.into the actual routeing of the network and testing this
